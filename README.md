# instaFilta2
This is the second major version instaFilta, a jQuery plugin for performing fast customizable in-page filtering. Both versions fulfill the same basic need, but they differ in how they are initiated. V1 kind of assumed that a text field was the starting point of the filtering process, whereas v2 starts with the actual list being filtered and then uses any number of triggers than fire off the filtering process. V2 can also combine the applied filters in a way that is just not possible in the first version.

I am currently working on an updated demo page for v2. Will also fill this README up with documentation as soon as time is given.
